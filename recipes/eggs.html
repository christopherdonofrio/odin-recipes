    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Scrambled eggs are a classic and versatile breakfast dish that can be prepared in a few simple steps. Begin by cracking the desired number of eggs into a bowl and whisking them until the yolks and whites are fully combined. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add a small amount of butter or oil to prevent sticking. Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet and let them cook undisturbed for a moment until the edges start to set. Use a spatula to gently push and fold the eggs from the edges towards the center, allowing the uncooked portions to come in contact with the heat. Continue stirring and folding until the eggs are mostly cooked but still slightly runny. Remove the skillet from heat, as residual heat will continue to cook the eggs. Let them rest for a minute to finish cooking to your desired level of doneness. Season with salt, pepper, and any desired herbs or spices. The result is a fluffy and delicious plate of scrambled eggs that can be enjoyed on their own, paired with toast or as a versatile base for various breakfast creations.</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Making Maruchan ramen is a quick and easy way to satisfy your hunger with a warm and flavorful bowl of noodles. Begin by boiling water in a pot, then open the ramen package and add the noodles to the boiling water. Allow the noodles to cook for a few minutes until they become tender. While the noodles are cooking, you can add the flavoring packet included in the ramen package to enhance the taste. Once the noodles are cooked to your desired texture, remove the pot from heat and transfer the contents to a bowl. You can customize your ramen by adding additional ingredients such as soft-boiled eggs, sliced green onions, or cooked vegetables.
